AI-Based Surveillance & Crowd Control System
One-Page Summary of Prototype
This prototype is designed for Simhastha 2028, one of the world’s largest human gatherings, where millions of pilgrims are expected. Managing such massive crowds poses serious challenges—ensuring safety, preventing overcrowding, locating missing persons, and enabling quick emergency response.
Our solution is an AI-powered, unified ecosystem combining a central command dashboard, AI-enabled CCTV and drone surveillance, visitor and police mobile applications, and predictive analytics. Together, they provide a smart, real-time monitoring and crowd management system that enhances safety, efficiency, and visitor experience.

Key Features & Functionalities
1. Central Command Dashboard
a. Real-time monitoring of threat levels, visitor count, active cameras, incidents, and personnel.
b. Categorization of incidents (medical, safety, crowd-related, technical).
c. Detailed issue tracker with type, location, priority, assignment, and live status.
d. Alerts and notifications broadcast to relevant teams instantly.

2. Visitor Management
a. Centralized pilgrim records with registration, KYC verification, and issue history.
b. Data flows directly from the Visitor Mobile App.

3. Issues & Reports
a. Logs and tracks incidents with priority, type, location, and status.
b. Supports real-time resolution monitoring.

4. Alerts Management
a. Authorities can broadcast urgent messages with priority, location, and target audience (e.g., police, medical, volunteers).

5. AI-Driven Surveillance (Integrated CCTV + Drones)
a. Real-time headcount, facial recognition, anomaly detection.
b. Drone announcements, thermal/LiDAR payloads, and predictive crowd movement analytics.

The Core Problem Being Addressed
1. Overcrowding and safety risks at ghats, gates, and hotspots.
2. Delays in emergency response due to communication gaps.
3. Difficulty locating missing persons in dense gatherings.
4. Lack of predictive intelligence for crowd surges and bottlenecks.

Clear Overview of Prototype / Idea
The system creates a unified, AI-powered safety and surveillance platform for mega-events.
1. For authorities: A single-window dashboard for monitoring, decision-making, and coordination.
2. For visitors: A mobile app providing offline navigation, SOS alerts, real-time crowd information, and multilingual assistance.
3. For operations: Scalable, modular architecture integrating existing CCTV, drones, and cloud systems for nationwide deployment.

This prototype demonstrates how AI, drones, and smart applications can work together to ensure safety, efficiency, and inclusivity at Simhastha 2028—and can be adapted to other mass gatherings across India.
